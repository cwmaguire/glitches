# glitches

Goofing around with ClojureScript and HTML5 Canvas: creates little "glitches" that traverse a canvas and wreck havoc.
Allows you to specify multiple functions to sort the surrounding pixels by before picking the first one; also allows you to specify which function should modify the chosen pixel.

## Usage

Compile with glitches.build/build-home, open glitches.html in a web browser, click "White" then click "Glitch!"
The reason for "White" is that it writes the initial data to the canvas if there isn't any. (I suppose I could do that on page load).

If you'd like the image buttons to work you'll have to wire them up to your own images.
To "glitch" an image simply click an image button and then click "Glitch!".

You can change where each "glitch" goes by changing the list of functions in glitches.glitch/go used to sort the surrounding pixels.
You can change what happens to the next pixel by changing the function passed into the first call to "crawl" (again, in glitches.glitch/go).
